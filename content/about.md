# What is wikis.win?

wikis.win is a platform created for the sole purpose of providing free access to quality information to those searching for it indefinitely, without collecting user data, advertisement or login walls.

This is not like [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), our goal is replace the [Reddit Wiki System](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/wiki/) to provide resources, so that the core knowledge of a community can be maintained without effort even if they shift platforms.

Our goal is to help create good wikis for communities around the world, which they can link to, even if the community is spread over multiple different platforms.

# Why does this exist?

Over the past few years, the experience for searching content around the internet is becoming horrible day by day. Information and tutorials which should be free to just see and read are behind pay walls or login walls, AI has come onto the scene and started pumping out content which, no offense to llm's, most of it is utter garbage and reading a bad AI written tutorial just ruins the day.

Another big issue is websites being filled to the brim with bloat and taking ages to load. Visitors just want to see the text, they don't wan't to wait 5 minutes for the site to load, go through 2 adverts, read 2 lines of content, click expand article/sign-in again wait 5 minutes and then be finally be able to read the content. We believe the ideal website should be close to [this](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/), just HTML, CSS and a little bit of Javascript(ðŸ¤®, preferably none).
